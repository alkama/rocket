Tips & tricks
-------------
* Fold away tracks or groups you are not currently working with using Alt+Left/Right and Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right

* Use Return to insert current interpolated value - also sets the interpolation type to what the previous key uses.

* A good way of bundling parameters for effects is by naming your tracks 'groupname:trackname', as this will group them together, thus making better tracknames than "logo-x-pos", "logo-y-pos", "title-x-pos", "title-y-pos". Groups can also be folded, so they don't take up screen estate when you are working on a different part of the demo.

* Insert bookmarks using the B key to easily jump between parts in the demo.

* To rename a track (or add it to a group), close the editor and open the .rocket xml file, which should be nicely formatted. Locate the track and rename it - then rename it in your demo.

* Bias using Alt+trackpad/scrollwheel. Add the Shift-key to bias even faster.

* Use selection to bias multiple keys - even across multiple tracks!
